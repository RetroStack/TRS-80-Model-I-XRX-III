# TRS-80 Model 1 XRX-II Mod

This project faithfully reimplements the small brown mod board often seen attached to the keyboard of an TRS-80 Model 1. It corrects a software bug in earlier versions of the Level II ROMs, a bug later fixed in version 1.3. The design replicates the original mod's functionality using a 1-to-1 PCB design, including components, interfaces, and even traces.

Since this mod is no longer required for the latest ROM version, there's no need to create it. If you have an older computer, simply update the ROMs, and this mod becomes unnecessary. This repository serves more as a historical record and recreation of the board rather than for implementation.
